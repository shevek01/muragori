    <article><p style="font-size:25px">Introductions<br>25 January 2021<br></p> <b>Why I made this site <br></b> 

	I have created this page to document projects and share my experiences. I want to keep a written record of my life and the things I am passionate about. I chose this format for a few reasons: 1) I want to be in complete of the content and layout 2) I found that no single social media platform has everything that I am looking for 3) I wanted a challenge and to try some thing new 

	I hope to get into a regular schedule of updating once a week keeping y’all updated on my random musings.

    <b><br> How I maintain this page</b> <br>

	I purchased this domain on Namecheap and manage it there. Netlify is the hosting service that I use. I code using either TextEdit or Brackets though I am trying to use Brackets less because i find myself relying on the auto suggestions too much. Upload files to Gitub which is linked to Netfly to publish new sites. 

	Im sure this set up will change in the future but as of now this suits my needs.<br> 

    <b>Who am I?</b> <br>
        Im just trynna finish up my history degrees that’s taken me too damn long. I currently work in retail and have held jobs in food service and health and human services. I am passionate about my community, socialism, fixed gear cycling, weed and music. My goal in life is to do what I like.
